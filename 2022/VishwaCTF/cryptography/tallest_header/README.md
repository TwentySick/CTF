## Challenge
## Solution
use strings to this file, look what we found
```
info.txtkey = [2,1,3,5,4]
ciphertext = RT1KC _YH43 3DRW_ T1HP_ R3M7U TA1N0PK
encrypt.pyPK
info.txtPK
```
And we have\
RT1KC => TR1CK\
_YH43 => Y_H34\
3DRW_ => D3R_W\
T1HP_ => 1TH_P\
R3M7U => 3RMU7\
TA1N0 => AT10N\

==> TR1CKY\_H34D3R\_W1TH\_P3RMU7AT10N\

Flag
```
{TR1CKY_H34D3R_W1TH_P3RMU7AT10N}
```
